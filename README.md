# Android_App_For_Movies
Movie Android App made as homework for M3-Java at Harbour Space
<br>
<br> The Movie App is working well and it displays the recycler view with all the movies.
<br>

<br> I didnt have time to implement the Async task with npoint.io, so I added the 
<br> strings with the fields as arrays in strings.xml
<br>
<br>
<br> Somehow the gradle check doesn't accept it:(
