# Android_App_For_Movies
Movie Android App made as homework for M3-Java at Harbour Space
<br> App is working well and displays the recycler view.
<br> Somehow the gradle check doesn't accept it:(
<br> I didnt have time to implement the Async task with npoint.io, so I added the 
<br> strings with the fields as arrays in strings.xml
